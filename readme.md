# Workout Classifier üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the process of building a deep-learning system capable of recognizing **22 different gym exercises** from short video clips. The notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the entire process, from data acquisition to model training and evaluation.

## What You'll Find in the Notebook

1.  **Dataset Download & Quick Tour**:
    * Instructions on how to obtain the [*Workout Fitness Video* dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasyimabdillah/workoutfitness-video).
    * Initial inspection of the dataset, including class balance, video clip length, and example frames.

2.  **Two Preprocessing Pipelines & Model Architectures**:
    * **Frame-based Approach**:
        * Extraction of RGB frames from video clips.
        * Training of image classification models:
            * A lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
            * A fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16).
    * **Pose-based Approach**:
        * Extraction of **3-D body landmarks** using MediaPipe Pose.
        * Appending per-joint velocities and confidence scores to the landmark data.
        * Feeding these sequences to custom **Multi-Stream models**:
            * ConvLSTM (Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory).
            * Transformer.
